## Project Description

A tool for anyone to try Tesseract OCR and see the results, without needing to install and run it themselves. The user can upload a document image to be processed by Tesseract 4.0. The result view shows the detected blocks, paragraphs, lines and words in a convenient visual format. Colour coding is used to show the confidence level of each word.

I was interested in seeing if Tesseract could be used as an underlying OCR engine to build document analysis applications on top of. I didn't find any convenient tools online for getting a feel for how Tesseract performs and what results and output to expect. So, I built this application to serve that purpose.




### Demo
